The IUCN has stated that it has assessed all known mammalian species.<ref>http://www.iucnredlist.org/initiatives/mammals/process/methods</ref> Because many of the species evaluated as ""[[Data Deficient]]"" are likely to have small distributions and/or populations, many are likely to be threatened.<ref>http://www.iucnredlist.org/initiatives/mammals/description/limitations</ref>

This is a list from IUCN's Red List of the 209 critically endangered mammalian species, 59 critically endangered subspecies and 17 critically endangered subpopulations or stocks as of 19 November 2015 (IUCN 2015.4)
